## It counts the occurrences of each value in column A within column C of the ‘Invoice’ sheet. 
## It applies this count to every cell in column A that contains data, outputting the result in the corresponding row. 
## If a cell in column A is empty, it leaves the output cell blank. 
## This is useful for summarizing how many times each entry in a list appears in another dataset.


=ARRAYFORMULA(
  IF(
    A6:A<>"", 
      COUNTIF(
        Invoice!C6:C, A6:A), "")
            )

## Same essence but self-querying:
  # It counts how many times a value in a specific cell repeats in its own column

=ARRAYFORMULA(
    IF(
      ISBLANK(C6),"", 
        IF(
          COUNTIF($C$6:$C, C6) = 45, "", 
            COUNTIF(
              $C$6:$C, C6)
            )))
